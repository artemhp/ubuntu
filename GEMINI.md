# Directory Overview

This directory is used to track and document configurations and adjustments for an Ubuntu operating system setup. It serves as a personal log of customizations.

# Key Files

*   `README.md`: The central file where all configurations are documented. It currently details terminal look-and-feel customizations, including font choices and a specific color palette.

# Usage

The primary purpose of this directory is to maintain a record of OS customizations. The `README.md` file should be updated whenever a new configuration change is made to the system. This allows for easy tracking and replication of the setup.
